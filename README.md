# EuroSAT LandCover Classfication using Deep Learning

# Introduction

This repository contains code for Land Cover Classification using a custom Convolutional Neural Network. 

# Libraries used 

PyTorch - PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Meta.

TorchGeo - A PyTorch-based library designed for geospatial deep learning by Microsoft. It contains datasets for remote sensing.

# Dataset 

The EuroSAT dataset is based on imagery from European Space Agency’s (ESA) Sentinel-2 satellite. It consists of 27,000 labeled and geo-referenced images with 10 different land use and land cover classes. This satellite data covers 13 spectral bands.

This dataset uses the train/val/test splits defined in the "In-domain representation learning for remote sensing" paper:
